    "### Linked list Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node. For example, ![concept](images/linked-list-concept.png) You have to start somewhere, so we give the address of the first node a special name called HEAD. Also, the last node in the linked list can be identified because its next portion points to NULL. Linked lists can be of multiple types: singly, doubly, and circular linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You might have played the game Treasure Hunt, where each clue includes the information about the next clue. That is how the linked list operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Representation of Linked List**\n",
    "Let's see how each node of the linked list is represented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each node consists:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A data item.\n",
    "- An address of another node.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wrap both the data item and the next node reference in a struct. \n",
    "![insert](images/linked-list-with-data.png)\n",
    "The power of a linked list comes from the ability to break the chain and rejoin it. E.g. if you wanted to put an element 4 between 1 and 2, the steps would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new struct node and allocate memory to it.\n",
    "- Add its data value as 4\n",
    "- Point its next pointer to the struct node containing 2 as the data value\n",
    "- Change the next pointer of \"1\" to the node we just created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing something similar in an array would have required shifting the positions of all the subsequent elements."

Apart from that, linked lists are a great way to learn how pointers work. By practicing how to manipulate linked lists, you can prepare yourself to learn more advanced data structures like graphs and trees."
