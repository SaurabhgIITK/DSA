    "A queue is an object (an abstract data structure - ADT) that allows the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue\n",
    "- Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue\n",
    "- IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty\n",

    "\n",
    "- two pointers FRONT and REAR\n",
    "- FRONT track the first element of the queue\n",
    "- REAR track the last element of the queue\n",
    "- initially, set value of FRONT and REAR to -1\n",

    "**Dequeue Operation**\n",
    "- check if the queue is empty\n",
